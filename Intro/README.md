### Introduction

## Learning Goals
* Introduction to the Reinforcement Learning and Understand the Reinforcement Learning problem and how it is differ from Supervised learning problem.

## Summary
* Reinforcement Learning (RL) is concerned with goal-directed learning and decision-making.
* In RL an agent learns from experiences it gains by interacting with the environment. In Supervised Learning we cannot affect the environment.
* In RL rewards are often delayed in time and the agent tries to maximize a long-term Cumulative Reward of goal. For example, one may need to make seemingly suboptimal moves to reach a winning position in a game.
* An agent interacts with the environment via states, actions and rewards.
